I face some problem with interfacing GPS to Pico W, so I used Arduino uno but it showed up perfectly with Arduino uno so I just changed to it. Your can use any one of your choice. Thank you! 
Here I used 
Ir sensor - to count passenger,
GPS module- for location,
LCD 16x2- display,
ESP-01- WIFI module,
bluetooth module,
motor and motor driver(L298N)- to control the model.

- **Programming Language:** Python, C
- **Embedded Systems:** Arduino uno,Rasberry pi pico W, ESP-01,and other components mentioned above
- **Cloud Services:** ThingSpeak
- **Development Tools:** Ardunio IDE, Jypter Notebook
