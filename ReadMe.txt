I faced some problems interfacing a GPS module with the Raspberry Pi Pico W, so I switched to an Arduino Uno, where it worked perfectly. You can use either one based on your preference. Thank you!
Here I used 
Ir sensor - to count passenger,
GPS module- for location,
LCD 16x2- display,
ESP-01- WIFI module,
bluetooth module,
motor and motor driver(L298N)- to control the model.

- **Embedded Systems:** Arduino uno,Rasberry pi pico W, ESP-01,and other components mentioned above
- **Cloud Services:** ThingSpeak
